abstract = {Extracting relevant information from large-scale data offers unprecedented opportunities in cancerology. We applied independent component analysis (ICA) to bladder cancer transcriptome data sets and interpreted the components using gene enrichment analysis and tumor-associated molecular, clinicopathological, and processing information. We identified components associated with biological processesoftumor cells or the tumor microenvironment, andother components revealed technical biases. Applying ICA to nine cancer types identified cancer-shared and bladder-cancer-specific components. We characterized the luminal and basal-like subtypes of muscle-invasive bladder cancers according to the components identified. The study of the urothelial differentiation component, specific to the luminal subtypes, showed that a molecular urothelial differentiation program was maintained even in those luminal tumors that had lost morphological differentiation. Study of the genomic alterations associated with this component coupled with functional studies revealed a protumorigenic role for PPARG in luminal tumors. Our results support the inclusion of ICA in the exploitation of multiscale data sets.},

abstract = {Abstract: New strategies are needed to predict response to platinum-based chemotherapy and outcome of ovarian cancers. We hypothesized that the mutator phenotype in the cancer genome represents the overuse of alternative DNA repair mechanisms, which might be a sign of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency and can be captured by gene expression. Multidimensional data of ovarian cancer patients and breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used for the development and validation of a potential clinical information-independent score that correlates with HR deficiency and predicts outcome. Correlation of the score with platinum response, outcome, and BRCA mutations was assessed. The score correlated with increased genomic mutation rate in both ovarian cancer and breast cancer cases that harbored a substantial subset of HR-deficient samples. Significantly improved outcomes were observed in the high-scoring group versus the low-scoring group in the TCGA dataset and in three large gene expression microarray datasets. A strong correlation was found between the score and the likelihood of achieving complete response to chemotherapy. The score was also found to be highly robust to noises in genomic mutations. Sixty-four patients harboring BRCA mutations were successfully divided into two groups based on scores, with the high-scoring group showing significantly improved outcomes compared with wild-type cases and the low-scoring group showing no significance in all the same analyses. The score was significantly correlated with the response to platinum therapy and outcome. Evaluation of the score as a prognostic tool in ovarian cancer patients is warranted. Key message: We develop a diagnostic signature for the HR-deficiency based on a novel hypothesis. HR-deficiency score is significantly correlated to platinum therapy and outcomes. HRDS was validated by its association with OS, PFS, DFS and CR in validation datasets. Evaluation of the score as a prognostic tool in ovarian cancer patients is warranted.},

abstract = {The stratification of cancer into subtypes that are significantly associated with clinical outcomes is beneficial for targeted prognosis and treatment. In this study, we integrated somatic mutation and gene expression data to identify clusters of patients. In contrast to previous studies, we constructed cancer-type-specific significant co-expression networks (SCNs) rather than using a fixed gene network across all cancers, such as the network-based stratification (NBS) method, which ignores cancer heterogeneity. For each type of cancer, the gene expression data were used to construct the SCN network, while the gene somatic mutation data were mapped onto the network, propagated, and used for further clustering. For the clustering, we adopted an improved network-regularized non-negative matrix factorization (netNMF) (netNMF-HC) for a more precise classification. We applied our method to various datasets, including ovarian cancer (OV), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) cohorts derived from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) project. Based on the results, we evaluated the performance of our method to identify survival-relevant subtypes and further compared it to the NBS method, which adopts priori networks and netNMF algorithm. The proposed algorithm outperformed the NBS method in identifying informative cancer subtypes that were significantly associated with clinical outcomes in most cancer types we studied. In particular, our method identified survival-associated UCEC subtypes that were not identified by the NBS method. Our analysis indicated valid subtyping of patient could be applied by mutation data with cancer-type-specific SCNs and netNMF-HC for individual cancers because of specific cancer co-expression patterns and more precise clustering.},

abstract = {Background Unsupervised compression algorithms applied to gene expression data extract latent, or hidden, signals representing technical and biological sources of variation. However, these algorithms require a user to select a biologically-appropriate latent dimensionality. In practice, most researchers select a single algorithm and latent dimensionality. We sought to determine the extent by which using multiple dimensionalities across ensemble compression models improves biological representations. Results We compressed gene expression data from three large datasets consisting of adult normal tissue, adult cancer tissue, and pediatric cancer tissue. We compressed these data into many latent dimensionalities ranging from 2 to 200. We observed various tradeoffs across latent dimensionalities and compression models. For example, we observed high model stability between principal components analysis (PCA), independent components analysis (ICA), and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). We identified more unique biological signatures in ensembles of denoising autoencoder (DAE) and variational autoencoder (VAE) models in intermediate latent dimensionalities. However, we captured the most pathway-associated features using all compressed features across algorithms and dimensionalities. Optimized at different latent dimensionalities, compression models detect generalizable gene expression signatures representing sex, neuroblastoma MYCN amplification, and cell types. In two supervised machine learning tasks, compressed features optimized predictions at different latent dimensionalities. Conclusions There is no single best latent dimensionality or compression algorithm for analyzing gene expression data. Instead, using feature ensembles from different compression models across latent space dimensionalities optimizes biological representations.},

abstract = {Recent genomic analyses of pathologically defined tumor types identify "within-a-tissue" disease subtypes. However, the extent to which genomic signatures are shared across tissues is still unclear. We performed an integrative analysis using five genome-wide platforms and one proteomic platform on 3,527 specimens from 12 cancer types, revealing a unified classification into 11 major subtypes. Five subtypes were nearly identical to their tissue-oforigin counterparts, but several distinct cancer types were found to converge into common subtypes. Lung squamous, head and neck, and a subset of bladder cancers coalesced into one subtype typified by TP53 alterations, TP63 amplifications, and high expression of immune and proliferation pathway genes. Of note, bladder cancers split into three pancancer subtypes. The multiplatform classification, while correlated with tissue-of-origin, provides independent information for predicting clinical outcomes. All data sets are available for data-mining from a unified resource to support further biological discoveries and insights into novel therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Independent component analysis (ICA) is a matrix factorization approach where the signals captured by each individual matrix factors are optimized to become as mutually independent as possible. Initially suggested for solving source blind separation problems in various fields, ICA was shown to be successful in analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and other types of biomedical data. In the last twenty years, ICA became a part of the standard machine learning toolbox, together with other matrix factorization methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Here, we review a number of recent works where ICA was shown to be a useful tool for unraveling the complexity of cancer biology from the analysis of different types of omics data, mainly collected for tumoral samples. Such works highlight the use of ICA in dimensionality reduction, deconvolution, data pre-processing, meta-analysis, and others applied to different data types (transcriptome, methylome, proteome, single-cell data). We particularly focus on the technical aspects of ICA application in omics studies such as using different protocols, determining the optimal number of components, assessing and improving reproducibility of the ICA results, and comparison with other popular matrix factorization techniques. We discuss the emerging ICA applications to the integrative analysis of multi-level omics datasets and introduce a conceptual view on ICA as a tool for defining functional subsystems of a complex biological system and their interactions under various conditions. Our review is accompanied by a Jupyter notebook which illustrates the discussed concepts and provides a practical tool for applying ICA to the analysis of cancer omics datasets.},
annote = {Another choice in applying ICA to a matrix of omics measurements is the choice between
what distribution independence (or non-Gaussianity) is maximized [18]. One can maximize the independence of metagenes (vectors sk) or metasamples (vectors ak). Technically, the first case corresponds to the application of ICA algorithm to the initial matrix X containing samples as rows and omics variables as columns, and the second case corresponds to the application of ICA to the transposed matrix X. Surprisingly, both ways of applying ICA to omics data are wide-spread, and sometimes it makes an effort to figure out in which way ICA was applied.

A: metasamples (k, samples)
S: metagenes (genes, k)

Discusses both orientations of X

If X is (samples, genes) then
X = A' S', maximises independence of metagenes, S'

If X is (genes, samples) then
X = S A, maximizes independence of metasamples A

"
The conclusion was that the stabilized version of ICA, where the non-Gaussianity of metagenes (and not metasamples) was maximized, is superior to other matrix factorization methods with respect to these measurements."

abstract = {Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer related death in the world with a five-year survival rate of less than 5{\%}. Not all PDAC are the same, because there exist intra-tumoral heterogeneity between PDAC, which poses a great challenge to personalized treatments for PDAC. Methods: To dissect the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC, we performed a retrospective meta-analysis on whole transcriptome data from more than 1200 PDAC patients. Subtypes were identified based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) biclustering method. We used the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and survival analysis to conduct the molecular and clinical characterization of the identified subtypes, respectively. Results: Six molecular and clinical distinct subtypes of PDAC: L1-L6, are identified and grouped into tumor-specific (L1, L2 and L6) and stroma-specific subtypes (L3, L4 and L5). For tumor-specific subtypes, L1 ({\~{}}22{\%}) has enriched carbohydrate metabolism-related gene sets and has intermediate survival. L2 ({\~{}}22{\%}) has the worst clinical outcomes, and is enriched for cell proliferation-related gene sets. About 23{\%} patients can be classified into L6, which leads to intermediate survival and is enriched for lipid and protein metabolism-related gene sets. Stroma-specific subtypes may contain high non-epithelial contents such as collagen, immune and islet cells, respectively. For instance, L3 ({\~{}}12{\%}) has poor survival and is enriched for collagen-associated gene sets. L4 ({\~{}}14{\%}) is enriched for various immune-related gene sets and has relatively good survival. And L5 ({\~{}}7{\%}) has good clinical outcomes and is enriched for neurotransmitter and insulin secretion related gene sets. In the meantime, we identified 160 subtype-specific markers and built a deep learning-based classifier for PDAC. We also applied our classification system on validation datasets and observed much similar molecular and clinical characteristics between subtypes. Conclusions: Our study is the largest cohort of PDAC gene expression profiles investigated so far, which greatly increased the statistical power and provided more robust results. We identified six molecular and clinical distinct subtypes to describe a more complete picture of the PDAC heterogeneity. The 160 subtype-specific markers and a deep learning based classification system may be used to better stratify PDAC patients for personalized treatments.},

abstract = {Gene expression profiling is an important tool to evaluate genetic heterogeneity in carcinomas and is useful to develop expression-based classifications for many types of cancer, as well as markers of disease outcome. In this study, we have investigated the expression profile of 22 genes involved in the PI3K-AKT pathway in 26 high-grade ovarian carcinomas (19 serous and 7 clear cell carcinomas). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering divided high-grade ovarian carcinomas into three groups. Although all clear cell carcinomas clustered in one group, high-grade serous carcinomas were segregated into two separate groups with different prognosis (P=0.05). High expression of CASP3, XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis), NFKB1, FAS, and GSK3B mRNAs identified high-grade serous carcinomas with better prognosis. In multivariate analysis, these cluster groups were of prognostic significance independent of age, tumor size, and tumor stage (P=0.008). To validate the mRNA expression data, we studied the immunohistochemical expression of caspase-3 and XIAP on a tissue microarray. Immunoreaction for caspase-3 was concordant with the results obtained by mRNA expression analysis (Spearman r=0.762, P=0.000). Caspase-3 was exclusively expressed by the macrophages. Furthermore, co-expression of caspase-3 and XIAP identified high-grade serous carcinomas with different prognosis (P=0.03). Our results suggest that there are different biological subtypes of high-grade serous carcinomas. {\textcopyright} 2011 USCAP, Inc. All rights reserved.},

The convenient access to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database allows for large-scale global gene expression profiling and database mining for potential correlation between genes and overall survival of a variety of malignancies including GBM. Previous reports have shown that tumor microenvironment cells and the extent of infiltrating immune and stromal cells in tumors contribute significantly to prognosis. Immune scores and stromal scores calculated based on the ESTIMATE algorithm could facilitate the quantification of the immune and stromal components in a tumor. To better understand the effects of genes involved in immune and stromal cells on prognosis, we categorized GBM cases in the TCGA database according to their immune/stromal scores into high and low score groups, and identified differentially expressed genes whose expression was significantly associated with prognosis in GBM patients. Functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction networks further showed that these genes mainly participated in immune response, extracellular matrix, and cell adhesion. Finally, we validated these genes in an independent GBM cohort from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). Thus, we obtained a list of tumor microenvironment-related genes that predict poor outcomes in GBM patients.},

abstract = {Purpose: Response to platinum-based therapy is a major prognostic factor in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). While the exact mechanisms of platinum-resistance remain unclear, evidence is accumulating for a connection between the organism's immune-response and response to platinum. However, predictive tools are missing. This study was performed to examine the putative role of the genetic tumor immune-microenvironment in mediating differential chemotherapy response in HGSOC patients. Patients and methods: Expression profiling of 770 immune-related genes was performed in tumor tissues from 23 HGSOC cases. Tumors were screened for prognostic and predictive biomarkers using the NanoString nCounter platform for digital gene expression analysis with the appurtenant PanCancer Immune Profiling panel. As validation cohort, gene expression data (RNA Seq) of 303 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) were retrieved from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Different scoring-systems were computed for prediction of risk-of-resistance to cisplatin, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Validated on the TCGA-dataset, the developed scores identified 11 significantly differentially expressed genes (p {\textless}0.01**) associated with platinum response. HSD11B1 was highly significantly associated with lower risk of recurrence and 7 targets were found highly significantly influencing OS time (p {\textless}0.01**). Conclusion: Our results suggest that response to platinum-based therapy and DFS in ovarian HGSOC is associated with distinct gene-expression patterns related to the tumor immune-system. We generated predictive scoring systems which proved valid when applied to a set of 303 EOC patients.},

abstract = {Background: There is evidence that some ovarian tumours evoke an immune response, which can be assessed by tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). To facilitate adoption of TILs as a clinical biomarker, a standardised method for their H{\&}E visual evaluation has been validated in breast cancer. Methods: We sought to investigate the prognostic significance of TILs in a study of 953 invasive epithelial ovarian cancer tumour samples, both primary and metastatic, from 707 patients from the prospective population-based SEARCH study. TILs were analysed using a standardised method based on H{\&}E staining producing a percentage score for stromal and intratumoral compartments. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios of the association between TILs and survival. Results: The extent of stromal and intra-tumoral TILs were correlated in the primary tumours (n = 679, Spearman's rank correlation = 0.60, P {\textless} 0.001) with a similar correlation in secondary tumours (n = 224, Spearman's rank correlation = 0.62, P {\textless} 0.001). There was a weak correlation between stromal TIL levels in primary and secondary tumour samples (Spearman's rank correlation = 0.29, P {\textless} 0.001) and intra-tumoral TIL levels in primary and secondary tumour samples (Spearman's rank correlation = 0.19, P = 0.0094). The extent of stromal TILs differed between histotypes (Pearson chi2 (12d.f.) 54.1, P {\textless} 0.0001) with higher levels of stromal infiltration in the high-grade serous and endometriod cases. A significant association was observed for higher intratumoral TIL levels and a favourable prognosis (HR 0.74 95{\%} CI 0.55-1.00 p = 0.047). Conclusion: This study is the largest collection of epithelial ovarian tumour samples evaluated for TILs. We have shown that stromal and intratumoral TIL levels are correlated and that their levels correlate with clinical variables such as tumour histological subtype. We have also shown that increased levels of both intratumoral and stromal TILs are associated with a better prognosis; however, this is only statistically significant for intratumoral TILs. This study suggests that a clinically useful immune prognostic indicator in epithelial ovarian cancer could be developed using this technique.},

abstract = {In the last decade, advances in high-throughput technologies such as DNA microarrays have made it possible to simultaneously measure the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes and proteins. This has resulted in large amounts of biological data requiring analysis and interpretation. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was introduced as an unsupervised, parts-based learning paradigm involving the decomposition of a nonnegative matrix V into two nonnegative matrices, W and H, via a multiplicative updates algorithm. In the context of a pxn gene expression matrix V consisting of observations on p genes from n samples, each column of W defines a metagene, and each column of H represents the metagene expression pattern of the corresponding sample. NMF has been primarily applied in an unsupervised setting in image and natural language processing. More recently, it has been successfully utilized in a variety of applications in computational biology. Examples include molecular pattern discovery, class comparison and prediction, cross-platform and cross-species analysis, functional characterization of genes and biomedical informatics. In this paper, we review this method as a data analytical and interpretive tool in computational biology with an emphasis on these applications. {\textcopyright} 2008 Karthik Devarajan.},

abstract = {The independent component analysis (ICA) of a random vector consists of searching for a linear transformation that minimizes the statistical dependence between its components. In order to define suitable search criteria, the expansion of mutual information is utilized as a function of cumulants of increasing orders. An efficient algorithm is proposed, which allows the computation of the ICA of a data matrix within a polynomial time. The concept of ICA may actually be seen as an extension of the principal component analysis (PCA), which can only impose independence up to the second order and, consequently, defines directions that are orthogonal. Potential applications of ICA include data analysis and compression, Bayesian detection, localization of sources, and blind identification and deconvolution.

abstract = {Because of the high risk of recurrence in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGS-OvCa), the development of outcome predictors could be valuable for patient stratification. Using the catalog of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we developed subtype and survival gene expression signatures, which, when combined, provide a prognostic model of HGS-OvCa classification, named "Classification of Ovarian Cancer" (CLOVAR). We validated CLOVAR on an independent dataset consisting of 879 HGS-OvCa expression profiles. The worst outcome group, accounting for 23{\%} of all cases, was associated with a median survival of 23 months and a platinum resistance rate of 63{\%}, versus a median survival of 46 months and platinum resistance rate of 23{\%} in other cases. Associating the outcome prediction model with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation status, residual disease after surgery, and disease stage further optimized outcome classification. Ovarian cancer is a disease in urgent need of more effective therapies. The spectrum of outcomes observed here and their association with CLOVAR signatures suggests variations in underlying tumor biology. Prospective validation of the CLOVAR model in the context of additional prognostic variables may provide a rationale for optimal combination of patient and treatment regimens.},

abstract = {Background: The amount of publicly available cancer-related "omics" data is constantly growing and can potentially be used to gain insights into the tumour biology of new cancer patients, their diagnosis and suitable treatment options. However, the integration of different datasets is not straightforward and requires specialized approaches to deal with heterogeneity at technical and biological levels. Methods: Here we present a method that can overcome technical biases, predict clinically relevant outcomes and identify tumour-related biological processes in patients using previously collected large discovery datasets. The approach is based on independent component analysis (ICA)-an unsupervised method of signal deconvolution. We developed parallel consensus ICA that robustly decomposes transcriptomics datasets into expression profiles with minimal mutual dependency. Results: By applying the method to a small cohort of primary melanoma and control samples combined with a large discovery melanoma dataset, we demonstrate that our method distinguishes cell-type specific signals from technical biases and allows to predict clinically relevant patient characteristics. We showed the potential of the method to predict cancer subtypes and estimate the activity of key tumour-related processes such as immune response, angiogenesis and cell proliferation. ICA-based risk score was proposed and its connection to patient survival was validated with an independent cohort of patients. Additionally, through integration of components identified for mRNA and miRNA data, the proposed method helped deducing biological functions of miRNAs, which would otherwise not be possible. Conclusions: We present a method that can be used to map new transcriptomic data from cancer patient samples onto large discovery datasets. The method corrects technical biases, helps characterizing activity of biological processes or cell types in the new samples and provides the prognosis of patient survival.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND It is unclear whether the transcriptional subtypes of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) apply to high grade clear cell (HGCCOC) or high grade endometrioid ovarian cancer (HGEOC). We aim to delineate transcriptional profiles of HGCCOCs and HGEOCs. METHODS We used Agilent microarrays to determine gene expression profiles of 276 well annotated ovarian cancers (OCs) including 37 HGCCOCs and 66 HGEOCs. We excluded low grade OCs as these are known to be distinct molecular entities. We applied the prespecified TCGA and CLOVAR gene signatures using consensus non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). RESULTS We confirm the presence of four TCGA transcriptional subtypes and their significant prognostic relevance (p{\textless}0.001) across all three histological subtypes (HGSOC, HGCCOC and HGEOCs). However, we also demonstrate that 22/37 (59{\%}) HGCCOCs and 30/67 (45{\%}) HGEOCs form 2 additional separate clusters with distinct gene signatures. Importantly, of the HGCCOC and HGEOCs that clustered separately 62{\%} and 65{\%} were early stage (FIGO I/II), respectively. These finding were confirmed using the reduced CLOVAR gene set for classification where most early stage HGCCOCs and HGEOCs formed a distinct cluster of their own. When restricting the analysis to the four TCGA signatures (ssGSEA or NMF with CLOVAR genes) most early stage HGCCOCs and HGEOC were assigned to the differentiated subtype. CONCLUSIONS Using transcriptional profiling the current study suggests that HGCCOCs and HGEOCs of advanced stage group together with HGSOCs. However, HGCCOCs and HGEOCs of early disease stages may have distinct transcriptional signatures similar to those seen in their low grade counterparts.},

abstract = {Obesity is an increasing health problem that is reported to influence chemotherapy dosing. The extent to which this occurs and whether this affects outcomes in ovarian cancer was unclear. To describe chemotherapy dosing practices in normal, overweight and obese patients treated for FIGO Stage III/IV serous ovarian cancer in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS). To evaluate the relationship between body mass index (BMI), dose intensity of chemotherapy received, overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). Methods Patient characteristics including age, height, weight, FIGO stage, serum creatinine, primary chemotherapy received and outcome data were extracted from medical records and entered into the AOCS database. Outcomes were analysed against BMI and relative dose intensity (RDI) received, based on calculations derived from a standard regimen (carboplatin AUC 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2). Results 333 women were included in the analysis. 27{\%} were overweight and 21{\%} were obese. In cycle 1 66{\%} of obese patients received carboplatin doses more than 5{\%} below their optimal calculated dose, and 32{\%} received sub-optimal paclitaxel doses, compared to 25{\%} and 13{\%} of normal weight patients respectively. Obese women were more likely to have received {\textless} 85{\%} RDI for carboplatin compared to normal weight women (p {\textless} 0.001). BMI group and RDI of carboplatin and paclitaxel were not predictors of OS. Women who received less than 85{\%} RDI for carboplatin had a worse PFS (univariate analysis, median PFS 11 versus 15 months; p = 0.04). There was no significant association between RDI and OS or PFS in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Obesity is common in ovarian cancer patients, and commonly results in lower chemotherapy dosing than recommended. Analysis of chemotherapy dosing from this study suggests that reduced dose intensity of carboplatin, which was more common in obese women, may impact on PFS in patients with advanced serous ovarian cancer. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Extracellular matrices (ECMs) are highly specialized and dynamic three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds into which cells reside in tissues. ECM is composed of a variety of fibrillar components, such as collagens, fibronectin, and elastin, and non-fibrillar molecules as proteoglycans, hyaluronan, and glycoproteins including matricellular proteins. These macromolecular components are interconnected forming complex networks that actively communicate with cells through binding to cell surface receptors and/or matrix effectors. ECMs exert diverse roles, either providing tissues with structural integrity and mechanical properties essential for tissue functions or regulating cell phenotype and functions to maintain tissue homeostasis. ECM molecular composition and structure vary among tissues, and is markedly modified during normal tissue repair as well as during the progression of various diseases. Actually, abnormal ECM remodeling occurring in pathologic circumstances drives disease progression by regulating cell–matrix interactions. The importance of matrix molecules to normal tissue functions is also highlighted by mutations in matrix genes that give rise to genetic disorders with diverse clinical phenotypes. In this review, we present critical and emerging issues related to matrix assembly in tissues and the multitasking roles for ECM in diseases such as osteoarthritis, fibrosis, cancer, and genetic diseases. The mechanisms underlying the various matrix-based diseases are also discussed. Research focused on the highly dynamic 3D ECM networks will help to discover matrix-related causative abnormalities of diseases as well as novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Among a litany of malignancies affecting the female reproductive tract, that of the ovary is the most frequently fatal. Moreover, while the steady pace of scientific discovery has fuelled recent ameliorations in the outcomes of many other cancers, the rates of mortality for ovarian cancer have been stagnant since around 1980. Yet despite the grim outlook, progress is being made towards better understanding the fundamental biology of this disease and how its biology in turn influences clinical behaviour. It has long been evident that ovarian cancer is not a unitary disease but rather a multiplicity of distinct malignancies that share a common anatomical site upon presentation. Of these, the high-grade serous subtype predominates in the clinical setting and is responsible for a disproportionate share of the fatalities from all forms of ovarian cancer. This review aims to provide a detailed overview of the clinical-pathological features of ovarian cancer with a particular focus on the high-grade serous subtype. Along with a description of the relevant clinical aspects of this disease, including novel trends in treatment strategies, this text will inform the reader of recent updates to the scientific literature regarding the origin, aetiology and molecular-genetic basis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).},

abstract = {Purpose: Gene-expression-based molecular subtypes of high-grade serous tubo- ovarian cancer (HGSOC), demonstrated across multiple studies, may provide improved stratification for molecularly targeted trials. However, evaluation of clinical utility has been hindered by non-standardized methods which are not applicable in a clinical setting. We sought to generate a clinical-grade minimal gene-set assay for classification of individual tumor specimens into HGSOC subtypes and confirm previously reported subtype-associated features. Experimental Design: Adopting two independent approaches, we derived and internally validated algorithms for subtype prediction using published gene-expression data from 1650 tumors. We applied resulting models to NanoString data on 3829 HGSOCs from the Ovarian Tumor Tissue Analysis Consortium. We further developed, confirmed, and validated a reduced, minimal gene-set predictor, with methods suitable for a single patient setting. Results: Gene-expression data was used to derive the Predictor of high-grade-serous Ovarian carcinoma molecular subTYPE (PrOTYPE) assay. We established a de facto standard as a consensus of two parallel approaches. PrOTYPE subtypes are significantly associated with age, stage, residual disease, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and outcome. The locked-down clinical-grade PrOTYPE test includes a model with 55 genes that predicted gene-expression subtype with {\textgreater}95{\%} accuracy that was maintained in all analytical and biological validations. Conclusions: We validated the PrOTYPE assay following the Institute of Medicine guidelines for the development of omics-based tests. This fully defined and locked-down clinical-grade assay will enable trial design with molecular subtype stratification and allow for objective assessment of the predictive value of HGSOC molecular subtypes in precision medicine applications},

However experimental and data processing conditions, which are proper to each dataset, generally influence the expression values and can hide the biological effect of interest. It is then important to normalize the bigger merged dataset regarding those batch effects, as failing to adjust for them may adversely impact statistical inference. In this context, we propose to use a “spatiotemporal” independent component analysis to model the influence of those unwanted effects and remove them from the data. We show on a real dataset that our method allows to improve this modeling and helps to improve sample classification tasks.},

abstract = {Purpose: Here we assess whether molecular subtyping identifies biological features of tumors that correlate with survival and surgical outcomes of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Experimental Design: Consensus clustering of pooled mRNA expression data from over 2,000 HGSOC cases was used to define molecular subtypes of HGSOCs. This de novo classification scheme was then applied to 381 Mayo Clinic HGSOC patients with detailed survival and surgical outcome information. Results: Five molecular subtypes of HGSOC were identified. In the pooled dataset, three subtypes were largely concordant with prior studies describing proliferative, mesenchymal, and immunoreactive tumors (concordance {\textgreater} 70{\%}), and the group of tumors previously described as differentiated type was segregated into two new types, one of which (anti-mesenchymal) had downregulation of genes that were typically upregulated in the mesenchymal subtype. Molecular subtypes were significantly associated with overall survival (P {\textless} 0.001) and with rate of optimal surgical debulking (≤1 cm, P = 1.9E-4) in the pooled dataset. Among stage III-C or IV Mayo Clinic patients, molecular subtypes were also significantly associated with overall survival (P = 0.001), as well as rate of complete surgical debulking (no residual disease; 16{\%} in mesenchymal tumors compared with {\textgreater}28{\%} in other subtypes; P = 0.02). Conclusions: HGSOC tumors may be categorized into five molecular subtypes that associate with overall survival and the extent of residual disease following debulking surgery. Because mesenchymal tumors may have features that were associated with less favorable surgical outcome, molecular subtyping may have future utility in guiding neoadjuvant treatment decisions for women with HGSOC.},

Here, we explore the growing list of mechanisms by which the ribosome is involved in carcinogenesis-from the hijacking of ribosomes by oncogenic factors and dysregulated translational control, to the effects of mutations in ribosomal components on cellular metabolism. Of clinical importance, the recent success of RNA polymerase inhibitors highlights the dependence on "onco-ribosomes" as an Achilles' heel of cancer cells and a promising target for further therapeutic intervention.Significance: The recent discovery of somatic mutations in ribosomal proteins in several cancers has strengthened the link between ribosome defects and cancer progression, while also raising the question of which cellular mechanisms such defects exploit.

abstract = {The objective of this research was to develop a robust gene expression-based prognostic signature and scoring system for predicting overall survival (OS) of patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Transcriptomic data of HGSOC patients were obtained from six independent studies in the NCBI GEO database. Genes significantly deregulated and associated with OS in HGSOCs were selected using GEO2R and Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank testing, respectively. Enrichment analysis for biological processes and pathways was performed using Gene Ontology analysis. A resampling/cross-validation method with Cox regression analysis was used to identify a novel gene expression-based signature associated with OS, and a prognostic scoring system was developed and further validated in nine independent HGSOC datasets. We first identified 488 significantly deregulated genes in HGSOC patients, of which 232 were found to be significantly associated with their OS. These genes were significantly enriched for cell cycle division, epithelial cell differentiation, p53 signaling pathway, vasculature development, and other processes. A novel 11-gene prognostic signature was identified and a prognostic scoring system was developed, which robustly predicted OS in HGSOC patients in 100 sampling test sets. The scoring system was further validated successfully in nine additional HGSOC public datasets. In conclusion, our integrative bioinformatics study combining transcriptomic and clinical data established an 11-gene prognostic signature for robust and reproducible prediction of OS in HGSOC patients. This signature could be of clinical value for guiding therapeutic selection and individualized treatment.},

abstract = {High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) exhibits extensive malignant clonal diversity with widespread but non-random patterns of disease dissemination. We investigated whether local immune microenvironment factors shape tumor progression properties at the interface of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and cancer cells. Through multi-region study of 212 samples from 38 patients with whole-genome sequencing, immunohistochemistry, histologic image analysis, gene expression profiling, and T and B cell receptor sequencing, we identified three immunologic subtypes across samples and extensive within-patient diversity. Epithelial CD8+ TILs negatively associated with malignant diversity, reflecting immunological pruning of tumor clones inferred by neoantigen depletion, HLA I loss of heterozygosity, and spatial tracking between T cell and tumor clones. In addition, combinatorial prognostic effects of mutational processes and immune properties were observed, illuminating how specific genomic aberration types associate with immune response and impact survival. We conclude that within-patient spatial immune microenvironment variation shapes intraperitoneal malignant spread, provoking new evolutionary perspectives on HGSC clonal dispersion. Integrated multi-region analysis of metastatic sites in patients with high-grade ovarian cancer highlights the connection between immune microenvironment variation and malignant spread, as well as the combinatorial prognostic value of immune and mutational features.},

In principle, the non-negativity constraint forces the representation to be sparse and parts based. Instead of extracting holistic features from the data, real parts are extracted that should be significantly easier to interpret and analyse. The size of the new subspace selects how many features will be extracted from the data. An effective choice should minimise the noise whilst extracting the key features. We propose a mechanism for selecting the subspace size by using a minimum description length technique. We demonstrate that our technique provides plausible estimates for real data as well as accurately predicting the known size of synthetic data.

More than a dozen different proteins have been identified as angiogenic activators and inhibitors. Levels of expression of angiogenic factors reflect the aggressiveness of tumor cells. The discovery of angiogenic inhibitors should help to reduce both morbidity and mortality from carcinomas. Thousands of patients have received antiangiogenic therapy to date. Despite their theoretical efficacy, antiangiogeic treatments have not proved beneficial in terms of long-term survival.

We identified groups of genes that distinguished the clear cell subtype from other ovarian carcinomas, grade I and II from grade III serous papillary carcinomas, and ovarian from breast carcinomas. Six clear cell carcinomas were distinguished from 36 other ovarian carcinomas (predominantly serous papillary) based on their gene expression patterns. The differences may yield insights into the worse prognosis and therapeutic resistance associated with clear cell carcinomas. A comparison of the gene expression patterns in the ovarian cancers to published data of gene expression in breast cancers revealed a large number of differentially expressed genes. We identified a group of 62 genes that correctly classified all 125 breast and ovarian cancer specimens. Among the best discriminators more highly expressed in the ovarian carcinomas were PAX8 (paired box gene 8), mesothelin, and ephrin-B1 (EFNB1). Although estrogen receptor was expressed in both the ovarian and breast cancers, genes that are coregulated with the estrogen receptor in breast cancers, including GATA-3, LIV-1, and X-box binding protein 1, did not show a similar pattern of coexpression in the ovarian cancers.

Clinical and genomic data of 590 samples from the high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma (HGOSC) study of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 91 samples from the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study were downloaded from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) portal. Clustering of mRNA microarray and reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) data was performed with 83 consensus driver genes and 144 obesity and lipid metabolism-related genes. Association between different clusters and survival was analyzed with the Kaplan–Meier method and a Cox regression. Mutually exclusive, co-occurrence and network analyses were also carried out. Using RNA and RPPA data, it was possible to identify two subsets of HGOSCs with similar clinical characteristics and cancer driver mutation profiles (e.g. TP53), but with different outcome. These differences depend more on up-regulation of specific obesity and lipid metabolism-related genes than on the number of gene mutations or copy number alterations. It was also found that CD36 and TGF-{\ss} are highly up-regulated at the protein levels in the cluster with the poorer outcome. In contrast, BSCL2 is highly up-regulated in the cluster with better progression-free and overall survival. Different obesity/metabolism-related gene expression patterns constitute a risk factor for prognosis independent of the therapy results in the Cox regression. Prognoses were conditioned by the differential expression of obesity and lipid metabolism-related genes in HGOSCs with similar cancer driver mutation profiles, independent of the initial therapeutic response.},

abstract = {Background: Analyzing the human transcriptome is crucial in advancing precision medicine, and the plethora of over half a million human microarray samples in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) has enabled us to better characterize biological processes at the molecular level. However, transcriptomic analysis is challenging because the data is inherently noisy and high-dimensional. Gene set analysis is currently widely used to alleviate the issue of high dimensionality, but the user-defined choice of gene sets can introduce biasness in results. In this paper, we advocate the use of a fixed set of transcriptomic modules for such analysis. We apply independent component analysis to the large collection of microarray data in GEO in order to discover reproducible transcriptomic modules that can be used as features for machine learning. We evaluate the usability of these modules across six studies, and demonstrate (1) their usage as features for sample classification, and also their robustness in dealing with small training sets, (2) their regularization of data when clustering samples and (3) the biological relevancy of differentially expressed features. Results: We identified 139 reproducible transcriptomic modules, which we term fundamental components (FCs). In studies with less than 50 samples, FC-space classification model outperformed their gene-space counterparts, with higher sensitivity (p{\textless}0.01). The models also had higher accuracy and negative predictive value (p{\textless}0.01) for small data sets (less than 30 samples). Additionally, we observed a reduction in batch effects when data is clustered in the FC-space. Finally, we found that differentially expressed FCs mapped to GO terms that were also identified via traditional gene-based approaches. Conclusions: The 139 FCs provide biologically-relevant summarization of transcriptomic data, and their performance in low sample settings suggest that they should be employed in such studies in order to harness the data efficiently.},

abstract = {Background: BRCA1 gene inactivation causes chromosomal instability, leading to rapid accumulation of chromosomal rearrangements and mutations. The loss of BRCA1 function due to either germline/somatic mutation or epigenetic silencing is observed in most high-grade serous carcinomas of the ovary. Methods: DNA ploidy and gene expression profile were used in order to compare gross genomic alteration and gene expression pattern between cases with BRCA1 loss through mutation, BRCA1 epigenetic loss, and no BRCA1 loss in cases of high-grade serous carcinoma with known BRCA1 and BRCA 2 status. Results: Using image cytometry and oligonucleotide microarrays, we analyzed DNA ploidy, S-phase fraction and gene expression profile of 28 consecutive cases of ovarian high-grade serous adenocarcinomas, which included 8 tumor samples with BRCA1 somatic or germline mutation, 9 samples with promoter hypermethylation of BRCA1, and 11 samples with no BRCA1 loss. None had BRCA2 mutations. The prevalence of aneuploidy and tetraploidy was not statistically different in the three groups with different BRCA1 status. The gene expression profiles were also very similar between the groups, with only two genes showing significant differential expression when comparison was made between the group with BRCA1 mutation and the group with no demonstrable BRCA1 loss. There were no genes showing significant differences in expression when the group with BRCA1 loss through epigenetic silencing was compared to either of the other two groups. Conclusions: In this series of 28 high-grade serous carcinomas, gross genomic alteration characterized by aneuploidy did not correlate with BRCA1 status. In addition, the gene expression profiles of the tumors showed negligible differences between the three defined groups based on BRCA1 status. This suggests that all ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas arise through oncogenic mechanisms that result in chromosomal instability, irrespective of BRCA status; the molecular abnormalities underlying this in the BRCA intact tumors remains unknown.},

abstract = {Background: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a method that models gene expression data as an action of a set of statistically independent hidden factors. The output of ICA depends on a fundamental parameter: the number of components (factors) to compute. The optimal choice of this parameter, related to determining the effective data dimension, remains an open question in the application of blind source separation techniques to transcriptomic data. Results: Here we address the question of optimizing the number of statistically independent components in the analysis of transcriptomic data for reproducibility of the components in multiple runs of ICA (within the same or within varying effective dimensions) and in multiple independent datasets. To this end, we introduce ranking of independent components based on their stability in multiple ICA computation runs and define a distinguished number of components (Most Stable Transcriptome Dimension, MSTD) corresponding to the point of the qualitative change of the stability profile. Based on a large body of data, we demonstrate that a sufficient number of dimensions is required for biological interpretability of the ICA decomposition and that the most stable components with ranks below MSTD have more chances to be reproduced in independent studies compared to the less stable ones. At the same time, we show that a transcriptomics dataset can be reduced to a relatively high number of dimensions without losing the interpretability of ICA, even though higher dimensions give rise to components driven by small gene sets. Conclusions: We suggest a protocol of ICA application to transcriptomics data with a possibility of prioritizing components with respect to their reproducibility that strengthens the biological interpretation. Computing too few components (much less than MSTD) is not optimal for interpretability of the results. The components ranked within MSTD range have more chances to be reproduced in independent studies.},

abstract = {Purpose: A better understanding of the underlying biology of invasive serous ovarian cancer is critical for the development of early detection strategies and new therapeutics. The objective of this study was to define gene expression patterns associated with favorable survival. Experimental Design: RNA from 65 serous ovarian cancers was analyzed using Affymetrix U133A microarrays.This included 54 stage III/IVcases (30 short-term survivors who lived {\textless}3 years and 24 long-term survivors who lived {\textgreater}7 years) and 11 stage I/II cases. Genes were screened on the basis of their level of and variability in expression, leaving 7,821 for use in developing a predictive model for survival. A composite predictive model was developed that combines Bayesian classification tree and multivariate discriminant models. Leave-one-out cross-validation was used to select and evaluate models. Results: Patterns of genes were identified that distinguish short-term and long-term ovarian cancer survivors. The expression model developed for advanced stage disease classified all 11 early-stage ovarian cancers as long-term survivors. The MAL gene, which has been shown to confer resistance to cancer therapy, was most highly overexpressed in short-term survivors (3-fold compared with long-term survivors, and 29-fold compared with early-stage cases). These results suggest that gene expression patterns underlie differences in outcome, and an examination of the genes that provide this discrimination reveals that many are implicated in processes that define the malignant phenotype. Conclusions: Differences in survival of advanced ovarian cancers are reflected by distinct patterns of gene expression. This biological distinction is further emphasized by the finding that earlystage cancers share expression patterns with the advanced stage long-term survivors, suggesting a shared favorable biology. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {Molecular stratification of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) for targeted therapy is a pertinent approach in improving prognosis of this highly heterogeneous disease. Enabling the same necessitates identification of class-specific biomarkers and their robust detection in the clinic. We have earlier resolved three discrete molecular HGSC classes associated with distinct functional behavior based on their gene expression patterns, biological networks, and pathways. An important difference revealed was that Class 1 is likely to exhibit cooperative cell migration (CCM), Class 2 undergoes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), while Class 3 is possibly capable of both modes of migration. In the present study, we define clinical stratification of HGSC tumors through the establishment of standard operating procedures for immunohistochemistry and histochemistry based detection of a panel of biomarkers including TCF21, E-cadherin, PARP1, Slug, AnnexinA2, and hyaluronan. Further development and application of scoring guidelines based on expression of this panel in cell line-derived xenografts, commercial tissue microarrays, and patient tumors led to definitive stratification of samples. Biomarker expression was observed to vary significantly between primary and metastatic tumors suggesting class switching during disease progression. Another interesting feature in the study was of enhanced CCM-marker expression in tumors following disease progression and chemotherapy. These stratification principles and the new information thus generated is the first step towards class-specific personalized therapies in the disease.},

abstract = {The identification of predictive biomarkers and novel targets to optimize immunotherapy strategies for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is urgently needed. CD38 is a multifunctional glycoprotein that acts as an ectoenzyme and immune receptor. However, the underlying immunological mechanisms and prognostic value of CD38 in EOC remain unclear. CD38 gene expression in EOC was evaluated by using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and TISIDB database. The prognostic value was calculated using GEPIA and Kaplan–Meier plotter. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted to study the roles of CD38 in the EOC microenvironment. Furthermore, the relationship between CD38 expression level and immune cell infiltration was analyzed by the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource and TISIDB. The GEPIA and TISIDB databases showed that CD38 expression in EOC was higher than that in normal tissue and was highest in the immunoreactive subtype among the four molecular types. A total of 424 cases from GEPIA revealed that high levels of CD38 were associated with longer disease-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.66, P = 0.00089] and increased overall survival rate (HR = 0.67, P = 0.0016). Kaplan–Meier plotter also confirmed the prognostic value of CD38 in EOC. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database demonstrated that gene signatures in many categories, such as immune response and adaptive immune response, were enriched in EOC samples with high CD38 expression. In addition, CD38 was positively correlated with immune cell infiltration, especially infiltration of activated CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells. CD38 is positively correlated with prognosis and immune cell infiltration in the EOC microenvironment and contributes to the regulation of antitumor immunity. CD38 could be used as a prognostic biomarker and potential immunotherapy target.},

abstract = {RNA-sequencing is rapidly becoming the method of choice for studying the full complexity of transcriptomes, however with increasing dimensionality, accurate gene ranking is becoming increasingly challenging. This paper proposes an accurate and sensitive gene ranking method that implements discriminant non-negative matrix factorization (DNMF) for RNA-seq data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore the utility of DNMF for gene ranking. When incorporating Fisher's discriminant criteria and setting the reduced dimension as two, DNMF learns two factors to approximate the original gene expression data, abstracting the up-regulated or down-regulated metagene by using the sample label information. The first factor denotes all the genes' weights of two metagenes as the additive combination of all genes, while the second learned factor represents the expression values of two metagenes. In the gene ranking stage, all the genes are ranked as a descending sequence according to the differential values of the metagene weights. Leveraging the nature of NMF and Fisher's criterion, DNMF can robustly boost the gene ranking performance. The Area Under the Curve analysis of differential expression analysis on two benchmarking tests of four RNA-seq data sets with similar phenotypes showed that our proposed DNMF-based gene ranking method outperforms other widely used methods. Moreover, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis also showed DNMF outweighs others. DNMF is also computationally efficient, substantially outperforming all other benchmarked methods. Consequently, we suggest DNMF is an effective method for the analysis of differential gene expression and gene ranking for RNA-seq data.},

abstract = {Background: We recently identified two robust ovarian cancer subtypes, defined by the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, with significant differences in clinical outcome. To identify potential regulatory mechanisms that distinguish the subtypes we applied PANDA, a method that uses an integrative approach to model information flow in gene regulatory networks. Results: We find distinct differences between networks that are active in the angiogenic and non-angiogenic subtypes, largely defined by a set of key transcription factors that, although previously reported to play a role in angiogenesis, are not strongly differentially-expressed between the subtypes. Our network analysis indicates that these factors are involved in the activation (or repression) of different genes in the two subtypes, resulting in differential expression of their network targets. Mechanisms mediating differences between subtypes include a previously unrecognized pro-angiogenic role for increased genome-wide DNA methylation and complex patterns of combinatorial regulation. Conclusions: The models we develop require a shift in our interpretation of the driving factors in biological networks away from the genes themselves and toward their interactions. The observed regulatory changes between subtypes suggest therapeutic interventions that may help in the treatment of ovarian cancer.},

The aim of our study was to validate previous candidate signatures in an independent setting and to identify single genes capable to serve as biomarkers for ovarian cancer progression. As several datasets are available in the GEO today, we were able to perform a true meta-analysis. First, 829 samples (11 datasets) were downloaded, and the predictive power of 16 previously published gene sets was assessed. Of these, eight were capable to discriminate histology subtypes, and none was capable to predict survival. To overcome the differences in previous studies, we used the 829 samples to identify new predictors. Then, we collected 64 ovarian cancer samples (median relapse-free survival 24.5 months) and performed TaqMan Real Time Polimerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) analysis for the best 40 genes associated with histology subtypes and survival. Over 90{\%} of subtype-associated genes were confirmed. Overall survival was effectively predicted by hormone receptors (PGR and ESR2) and by TSPAN8. Relapse-free survival was predicted by MAPT and SNCG. In summary, we successfully validated several gene sets in a meta-analysis in large datasets of ovarian samples.

We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems.
